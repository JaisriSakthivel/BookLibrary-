                <p><strong>Author:</strong>MARGARET ATWOOD</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>In Margaret Atwood’s dystopian future, environmental disasters and declining birth rates have led to a Second American Civil War. The result is the rise of the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian regime that enforces rigid social roles and enslaves the few remaining fertile women. Offred is one of these, a Handmaid deprived of her husband, her child, her freedom, and even her own name. At once a scathing satire, an ominous warning, and a tour de force of narrative suspense, The Handmaid’s Tale is a modern classic.</p>
